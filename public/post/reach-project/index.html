    	<p>My role in this project was to; develop User Interviews questions and assist the Client in conducting interviews, create personas and scenarios, create website wireframes, develop the visual style direction, and design posters. Through user research we discovered that the users needed a website that was clear, simple, and made it easy for them to find information and get the assistance they need. This was done with a simple site structure with well defined sections and calls to action. For the visual style of the site we collaborated with the animation team, using character illustrations and colours to ensure consistency between the two. We were sure to make sure that the animations and textures did not make the site overwhelming, or distract from the content, for the users.</p>
