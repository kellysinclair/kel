      <description>My role in this project was to; develop User Interviews questions and assist the Client in conducting interviews, create personas and scenarios, create website wireframes, develop the visual style direction, and design posters. Through user research we discovered that the users needed a website that was clear, simple, and made it easy for them to find information and get the assistance they need. This was done with a simple site structure with well defined sections and calls to action.</description>

      <description>After close collaboration with Browsers Books, we chose to incorporate hand drawn elements, textures, and fantastic imagery in their website design. The textures and drawings help to give the feel of old books, as well as matching with their rustic new store interior. The font pairing was chosen to maintain the book feel, while still having clear and easy to read content.</description>

      <description>With this site I made sure to keep a clean an open design look, as this gives a professional, and trustworthy feel. To make sure that it didnâ€™t lack character, the typography and elements from the brand were included throughout the design. These brand elements can be seen in the buttons, subtle background images, and content area shapes.</description>
