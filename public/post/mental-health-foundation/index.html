    	<div class="text-container">
    	<p>I was tasked with interviewing users, creating personas, and scenarios. I then provided my findings in an expert report to the Mental Health Foundation. Throughout this process I discovered that users were different than expected. The inital assumption was that people in a managerial role would be using the Workplace Wellbeing information, but in reality it was the Health and Safety roles. We also found a problem with the overall Information Architecture of the website. The users didn&rsquo;t understand the terminology used in the sitemap, and thus couldn&rsquo;t find what they were looking for.</p>

<p>The report included a list of recommendations that could be done right away, and a list for future projects and improvements to better help them serve this information to users.</p>
