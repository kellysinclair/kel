      <description>We found out that BusIt had an idea of their user groups, but not what each one would need, and want, to make their transit experience easy. We decided that the best way to engage with users was for me to get on the bus and talk to them. Through doing this we learnt about all the small things that different people experience when taking a bus. Such as visually impaired people having to use the sound of the bus to wave it down, and count the stops to know when to get off.</description>

      <description>We took a user centered approach to the redesign of the website. My role in project was to conduct user interviews, create personas, produce wireframes, and complete user testing. We found that there were a few key things that users needed to know when planning a trip to the zoo. Those being:
 Zoo events Opening hours Ticket prices Location Weather conditions  We used a home page banner to show off what’s on at the zoo.</description>

      <description>With this site I made sure to keep a clean and open design look, as this gives a professional, and trustworthy feel. To make sure that it didn’t lack character, the typography and elements from the brand were included throughout the design. These brand elements can be seen in the buttons, subtle background images, and the shape of content areas.</description>

      <description>They needed a site that met their unique book shop experience and complimented their new look space. After close collaboration with Browsers Books, we chose to incorporate hand drawn elements, textures, and fantastic imagery in their website design. The textures and drawings help to give the feel of old books, as well as matching with their rustic new store interior. The font pairing was chosen to maintain the book feel, while still having clear and easy to read content.</description>
