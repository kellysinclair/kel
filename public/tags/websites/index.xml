      <description>Through meeting and planning out the stages in the project we found out that BusIt had an idea of their user groups but not what each one would need, and want, to make their transit experience the best. We decided early on that the best way to engage with users was for me to get on the bus and talk to them. Through doing this we learn’t about all the small things that different people experience when taking a bus such as blind/visually impaired people using the sound of the bus to wave it down, the visually impaired using colour to find their bus on a time table.</description>

      <description>We took a user centered approach to the redesign of the website, and my role in project was to conduct user interviews, create personas, produce wireframes, and complete user testing. We found that there were a few key things that users needed to know when planning a trip to the zoo. Those being; zoo events, opening hours, ticket prices, location, and the weather conditions. We used a home page banner to show off what’s on at the zoo, followed by a bar that quickly points people to finding opening hours, ticket prices, location, and the weather conditions.</description>

      <description>My role in this project was to:
 Develop user interview questions Assist the Client in conducting interviews Create personas and scenarios Create website wireframes Develop the visual style direction Design posters.  Through user research we discovered that the users needed a website that made it easy for them to find information and get the assistance they need. This was done with a simple site structure with well defined sections and calls to action.</description>

      <description>With this site I made sure to keep a clean and open design look, as this gives a professional, and trustworthy feel. To make sure that it didn’t lack character, the typography and elements from the brand were included throughout the design. These brand elements can be seen in the buttons, subtle background images, and the shape of content areas.</description>

      <description>They needed a site that met their unique book shop experience and complimented their new look space. After close collaboration with Browsers Books, we chose to incorporate hand drawn elements, textures, and fantastic imagery in their website design. The textures and drawings help to give the feel of old books, as well as matching with their rustic new store interior. The font pairing was chosen to maintain the book feel, while still having clear and easy to read content.</description>
