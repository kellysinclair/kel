description: "BusIt is the Hamilton and Waikato Region bus service provider. They knew they needed a new site but didn't know what their users needed. That's where I come in. Through UX, wireframes, and design."

Through meeting and planning out the stages in the project we found out that BusIt had an idea of their user groups but not what each one would need, and want, to make their transit experience the best. We decided early on that the best way to engage with users was for me to get on the bus and talk to them. Through doing this we learn’t about all the small things that different people experience when taking a bus such as blind/visually impaired people using the sound of the bus to wave it down, the visually impaired using colour to find their bus on a time table.

When we’d completed all the interviews we went away and created some wireframes in Sketch and made them interactive via Invision, we then organised for some of the people we had interviewed to come in and test them. We were able to correct navigational errors, iterate and test with more users which gave us the room to create a well rounded experience.

For the visual style we aimed to keep it clean and light as we wanted to focus on accessibility and ensuring users could use it efficiently. We added subtle details to the design such as route map graphics in the headers and angled lines to keep in style with their visual direction.
