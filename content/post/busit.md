description: "BusIt is the Hamilton and Waikato Region bus service provider. They wanted to improve the way the bus timetables and real time data is presented to their users, as well as improving the overall look and feel of the website design."

I rode the buses and talked to the users, learning how people interact with the bus service, and how we could make things easier for them through the website. After gathering data on the users I created personas to refer to throughout the project, created wireframes and a prototype to test with users. Through prototype testing we were able to iterate quickly and ensure that the final website layout and functionality made sense for our users. Once the website wireframes were finalised the visual style was applied. Visual design was kept clean and simple, with special little details such as route map graphics, and angled lines to make the website unique.
