description: "Reach is a support service for people who are registered as job seekers, and manage a health issue or disability. The Reach team takes time to listen, support and walk with people on their journey to wellbeing. We were approached by the Reach team to rebuild their identity and create a web presence. They also teamed with an animation company to create an animation to show how the program works."

My role in this project was to; develop User Interviews questions and assist the Client in conducting interviews, create personas and scenarios, create website wireframes, develop the visual style direction, and design posters. Through user research we discovered that the users needed a website that was clear, simple, and made it easy for them to find information and get the assistance they need. This was done with a simple site structure with well defined sections and calls to action. For the visual style of the site we collaborated with the animation team, using character illustrations and colours to ensure consistency between the two. We were sure to make sure that the character illustrations and textures did not make the site overwhelming, or distract from the content, for the users.
