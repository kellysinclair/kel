My role in this project was to:

* Develop user interview questions
* Assist the Client in conducting interviews
* Create personas and scenarios
* Create website wireframes
* Develop the visual style direction
* Design posters.

 Through user research we discovered that the users needed a website that made it easy for them to find information and get the assistance they need. This was done with a simple site structure with well defined sections and calls to action. For the visual style of the site we collaborated with the animation team, using character illustrations and colours to ensure consistency between the two. We made sure that the character illustrations and textures did not make the site overwhelming, or distract from the content.
