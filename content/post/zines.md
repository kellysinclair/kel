description: "In my spare time I like creating. Making stuff. From drawing and painting to sewing and baking. I love hand lettering and drawing. I started making little zines, then I heard about Hamilton Zine Fest. I ended up going along, and sold and traded my zines."

I like to make things that people can relate to, but also that mean something to me. Two of my zines are focused on mental wellbeing, as I believe that speaking out about Mental Illness is important, especially if we want to remove the stigma around it. I drew elements of the zine separately, scanned them, and then created the layout and a printable file.
