description: "The Mental Health foundation had a Workplace Wellbeing section on their website but were not sure how or even if users were engaging with it. We decided we needed to talk to users and understand how they were engaging with the site at large when trying to find the information"

I was tasked with interviewing users, creating personas and scenarios. I then provided my findings in an expert report to the Mental Health Foundation. Throughout this process I discovered that users were different than expected. There was a problem with the overall Information Architecture of the website. The users didn't understand the sitemap and the terminology used on the site. 

The report included a list of recommendations that could be done right away without any extra work, and a list for future projects and improvements to better help them communicate.
