I was tasked with interviewing users, creating personas and scenarios, then providing my findings in an expert report to the Mental Health Foundation. I discovered that users were different than expected and that there was a problem with the overall Information Architecture of the website. The report included a list of recommendations that could be done right away without any extra work, and a list for future projects.
