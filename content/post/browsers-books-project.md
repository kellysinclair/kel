description: "Browsers Books is a well loved secondhand book store in Hamilton, New Zealand. After 20 years, they made a move to a new location and a new look store. Along with the new store, they updated their brand, and the next to get a refresh was their website. They needed a site that met their unique book shop experience and complimented their new look space.â€¨"

After close collaboration with Browsers Books, we chose to incorporate hand drawn elements, textures, and fantastic imagery in their website design. The textures and drawings help to give the feel of old books, as well as matching with their rustic new store interior. The font pairing was chosen to maintain the book feel, while still having clear and easy to read content.
