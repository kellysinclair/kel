description: "Wynter Recruitment is an Auckland based recruitment company, that specialises in construction, property and business support recruitment. As Wynter grew, it became apparent that they needed to refresh their brand and website. They came to us with their refreshed brand, and we worked together to bring their website up to the same clean and professional standard."

With this site I made sure to keep a clean and open design look, as this gives a professional, and trustworthy feel. To make sure that it didnâ€™t lack character, the typography and elements from the brand were included throughout the design. These brand elements can be seen in the buttons, subtle background images, and the shape of content areas.
