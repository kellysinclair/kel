description: "Hamilton Zoo - the home of many school trips, and a great outing for kids. Their website hadn’t had a refresh in quite a few years, so it was time to give it some love to show of all of their amazing animals."

We took a user centered approach to the redesign of the website. My role in project was to conduct user interviews, create personas, produce wireframes, and complete user testing. We found that there were a few key things that users needed to know when planning a trip to the zoo. 
Those being:

* Zoo events
* Opening hours
* Ticket prices 
* Location 
* Weather conditions

We used a home page banner to show off what’s on at the zoo. Following the banner is a bar that quickly allows people to find the information they need to make the decision to go to zoo.
