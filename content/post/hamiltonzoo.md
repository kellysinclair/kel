description: "Hamilton Zoo is a full of wonderful animals, many schools take trips there, and it’s a great school holiday outing for kids. The website hadn’t had a refresh in quite a few years, so it was time to give it some love, and show of all the amazing animals."

We took a user centered approach to the redesign of the website, and my role in project was to conduct user interviews, create personas, produce wireframes, and complete user testing. We found that there were a few key things that users needed to know when planning a trip to the zoo. Those being; zoo events, opening hours, ticket prices, location, and the weather conditions. We used a home page banner to show off what’s on at the zoo, followed by a bar that quickly points people to finding opening hours, ticket prices, location, and the weather conditions.
