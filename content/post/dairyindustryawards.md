description: "NZ Dairy Industry Awards are well known within the farming community. Their brand was dated and needed refreshing to better represent the prestigious competition. The awards have three competitions, the brand needed to be flexible and work for each. "

We spoke to past winners of the competitions to understand what the awards mean to them. The key themes of these discussions were that it is about the dairy cow, striving for continuous improvement, and the kiwi farming community. To represent these themes we used a cow contained in a circle shape, paired with a strong font reminiscent of old farm and small town signs. The text ‘Dairy Industry Awards’ is easily swapped out with the competition in question when required, and the device and text portions can be separated and used alone.
